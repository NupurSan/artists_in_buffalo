Artwork Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of artworks and items from a collection based in Buffalo, NY. It uses a series of Python functions to help with data processing, cleaning, visualization, and management. Functions like getValuesForKey, countMatchesByKey, filterByKey, and computeFrequency make it easy to extract data, count occurrences, filter specific entries, and calculate frequency distributions for different attributes. The project also includes tools for loading data from CSV files, converting it into a usable format, and caching data to make retrieval faster. Data cleaning methods ensure categories are standardized for consistency across the dataset. For visual insights, functions like plotPieForKey, plotBarForKey, and plotFilteredBarForKey help reveal patterns and frequencies, making it easier to analyze and understand the data. Overall, this project serves as a toolkit for exploring and gaining insights from artwork collections, helping inform data-driven decisions.
