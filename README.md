Artwork Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing information about artworks or items in a collection, primarily sourced from Buffalo, NY. The project encompasses a suite of Python functions designed for data processing, cleaning, visualization, and management. Functions such as getValuesForKey, countMatchesByKey, filterByKey, and computeFrequency facilitate tasks like extracting values, counting occurrences, filtering data based on specific criteria, and computing frequency distributions for various attributes. The project also includes functionalities for loading data from CSV files, converting it into usable formats, and caching data for efficient retrieval. Additionally, data cleaning methods standardize categories within the dataset for consistency. Visualization functions like plotPieForKey, plotBarForKey, and plotFilteredBarForKey offer insights into data distributions and frequencies, aiding in better understanding and analysis. This project serves as a comprehensive toolkit for exploring and understanding artwork collections, fostering data-driven insights and decision-making processes.
